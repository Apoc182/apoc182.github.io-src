<p>Hey gang! It’s been a while since I wrote on here and that has mainly been because I haven’t really had anything to say. But I have thought of something I would like to say now, and I am going to take this opportunity to say it.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas break, I was fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time with some good people. We ate, we drank and were merry. During this reprieve from the soulless corporate machine I humbly serve, I was able to get some perspective on the year ahead of me. I know what you’re thinking: ‘ah, here come the New Year’s Resolutions,’ but I promise it’s not! I hate them. I tell myself it is because I think that it puts too much pressure on people to get things done and causes their inevitable burn-outs and failures but it’s probably really because I think it’s cool to go against the current.</p>
<p>So, this year I’m committing to the things that need to be done. I need to work harder on this site and produce some more quality content. I am thinking about starting some video tutorials here as well. I am going to put more effort into my health by purchasing more fresh food rather than the rubbish I usually eat on the go. I am completely cutting alcohol out of my diet because it makes my brain foggy and this organ could be valuable in a science-type career. </p>
<p>There is an important quote I read that resonates with me and I feel it sums up the direction of my current thoughts well. Most places you find it on the internet it has been erroneously attributed to the late Aristotle. The quote is:</p>
<h1>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</h1>
<p>There seems to be some juicy flesh to this statement. I mean, in a lot of ways it is common sense. You can’t just be a serial killer then save a little girl from a burning house to be considered excellent. You can no more design an okay website once and go back to playing video games every day by the same token. It is in working at this repetition that we can begin to build something worth holding on to. That repetition can be automated by developing habits. There’s a little personal philosophy from me.</p>
<p>I heard it said once that it takes around three months to cement a habit. So, join with me and let's start investing in a happy future!</p>
