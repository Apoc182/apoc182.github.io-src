&lt;p&gt;I once set a fridge on fire. It was knackered and laying on its side in the Tasmanian wilderness when we found it, having assumably ceased to keep things cold at some point in its life. We had spent the afternoon tearing up 4WD trails and drinking many litres of beer but now, the light was rapidly vanishing behind the mountains in the west. It was getting colder, and as it was already cold (being Tasmania), we had no desire to get any colder. So we had managed to extract some petroleum from the fuel tank to burn. We struggled to keep a flame against the strong, icy breeze so we had the brilliant idea of using this fridge as a fire pot. Before we knew it, there was black smoke billowing out of it uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night was fun. Not because we set the fridge on fire, but the 4WDing itself was great. I quite enjoy driving down seemingly impossible paths and drinking my weight in alcohol. Maybe it’s in my blood or perhaps I was more carefree back then than I am now. Either way, I’d like my kids to be able to enjoy the same things I have. It is also important to me that maintain a healthy respect for the environment in which they are doing it. I don’t think you have to be a koala-shooting redneck to enjoy these kinds of things. If done in the same place and care is taken not to throw stuff out the windows and what not, I think the impact is fairly manageable. The fridge fire was an accident ok? Don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, bushlands like the one I used to enjoy has been burning uncontrollably, taking lives and homes with it. It has been a really dark time for all of us Australians. Social media has been absolutely awash with politically polarised ideas on who is to blame. I have seen videos of people just yelling at a camera about who they think is to blame for the current events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, there seems to be two sides to the argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Greenies did it! They let our dead wood build up over time with their stupid environment policies and now the whole country is on fire and they are trying to cover it up!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The climate is warming. We haven’t seen any rain in a year and the temperature of the planet is generally one degree warmer than it was in 1910”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is the world going to superheat like an oven and cook us human beings like chooks? Or are we all just the victims of environmental extremism? It is hard for most people to get access to accurate information to answer this question for themselves. There are so many reasons to distrust the powers that be and X website tells you one thing while Y tells you another. Then you have the government swearing black and blue that they didn’t do it and the fault lies at the feet of the Greens. It’s an attractive idea to a lot of people because a simple line of reasoning clearly shows who is to blame. It’s unfortunate that is actually is not accurate. Here is an excerpt from the party’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Hazard reduction, including manual, mechanical and hazard reduction burning activities should be strategically planned to protect the community and vulnerable assets while minimising the adverse impacts of these activities on the environment;”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I have spent a great deal of time trying to find any evidence at all that The Greens are responsible for this, but all that is available is Barnaby Joyce’s casual conjecture that “the two people that died were people who most likely voted for The Green party”[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As this isn’t particularly compelling, that more or less makes this a conspiracy theory and I don’t much like conspiracy theories, but the reasons for that are for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a government at the moment that is happy to exploit their people’s fear and completely ignore the global catastrophe that is looming around the corner and to be honest, it is becoming somewhat alarming. Every day that goes by with these people in charge pointing their finger at everyone but themselves while people’s lives are being destroyed is one more day we can’t get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have kids, you know that they can be little terrorists. One thing they like to do when they’re little and haven’t received the proper amount of discipline yet is lie. They say it was Suzie who ate all the chocolate cake, all the while their hands are covered in chocolate covered debris. We (hopefully) explain to our kids that finger pointing is bad, especially when it is unfactual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you think it’s time we tell the liberals the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Another way to concatenate strings.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, sorry it's been a fortnight! I've been hella busy and still am so this is going to be short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I recently discovered the f-string in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; are pretty damned cool!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;f-strings&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm sure most of us …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jcohenmediation.com/divorcing-know-f-word/"&gt;Image credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Another way to concatenate strings.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, sorry it's been a fortnight! I've been hella busy and still am so this is going to be short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I recently discovered the f-string in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; are pretty damned cool!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;f-strings&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm sure most of us are familiar with the above for good old string concatenation. If you are super tricky, you might even know…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; are pretty damned cool!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;f-strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{0}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are both well and good, but I have recently learned of a method i enjoy more than both of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; are pretty damned cool!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;f-strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{a_string}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again! Welcome to another Monday and another short one for you here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, have you ever needed to make a PDF file programmatically? I know I have. One of the main advantages of having a pdf as opposed to some other graphical format is being able to print them from the right click (context) menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest method of programmatically styling something like this in my experience seems to be HTML. Once you have this, simply use some kind of library to convert it into a PDF. Right? Well, kind of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, another nuance to this thing here is that generally speaking, you want your applications to be independent of the OS and environment. Well, you might wanna have Python and a couple of packages installed, but that’s it. Let’s not rely on the user to install anything external.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/xhtml2pdf/"&gt;xhtml2pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was unable to find any clear cut instructions on how to do this locally, so let me save you some trouble and walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;xhtml2pdf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pisa&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;jinja2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FileSystemLoader&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, let's import the pisa module from the xhtml2pdf package. Optionally, you can import the Environment and FileSystemLoader modules from &lt;a href="[http://jinja.pocoo.org/](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)"&gt;jinja2&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to populate a html template with some data. Then, provided you want to use Jinja2…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FileSystemLoader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;searchpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;./&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;./Template.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We create an environment specifying we want to load from the filesystem and that the place to load from is the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output_from_parsed_template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Above, we are grabbing the properly formatted jinja template (with {{ variables }} and the like), and populating it with data. If you want to know more about that, google it. It's not the focus of what I'm talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;outputFilename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;w+b&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;pisaStatus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CreatePDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output_from_parsed_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;./output_pdf&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the above, we open some kind of output file for writing as binary. Then, we use the CreatePDF function from pisa to do the magic. Pure, pythonic conversion. Then of course, we tidy up and close the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all there is too it folks! Hope that was helpful to someone!

&lt;h1&gt;Hi there!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought I'd give a big hi today in apologies for the lack of length that this blog post has in comparison with my somewhat hectic previous one. I can't consistently keep banging out blog posts that long though, I'm pretty busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So… List Comprehensions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving right along I have learnt how to use a fantastic paradigm in python for creating lists based on other lists called list comprehensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A list of numbers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;old_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create a new list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Iterate through previous list and add only the even numbers to the new list.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;old_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cool! So obviously what we are trying to do here is extract the even numbers from the old list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets try that out using list comprehensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A list of numbers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;old_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;old_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Would you look at that? The new list creation is now a one liner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Awesome, so how does it work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked. So, as the name suggests, python is capable of 'comprehending' lists in a simplified way that makes reading a breeze (once you get used to it). A basic format might be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ITEM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ORIGINAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LIST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ITEM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ORIGINAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LIST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ORIGINAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LIST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could swing in the opposite direction and just go to town on the conditions and chain if statements like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;old_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;That's all for this week!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, short and sweet today. Tune in next week for some more geek talk!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Career"></category></entry><entry><title>A Star</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/a-star.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-27T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2019-05-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2019-05-27:/a-star.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/"&gt;Image credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why A Star?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for game development, we were in a situation where we had a player that you could swap for any one of three characters. These characters needed to follow along behind the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I could do something simple like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;if …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/"&gt;Image credit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why A Star?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for game development, we were in a situation where we had a player that you could swap for any one of three characters. These characters needed to follow along behind the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I could do something simple like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;if(player.x &amp;gt; character.x) character.x++&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;if(player.x &amp;lt; character.x) character.x--&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a simplification but it illustrates the general idea. So then jumping becomes an issue. Say we have a hole in the ground in front of the player. The player jumps over it, leaving the following character in an existential crisis about how to overcome the dilemma before it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could have the player object leave some kind of marker indicating a jump needed to be performed here and there are indeed some pathfinding systems that work this way. Donkey Kong on the Super Nintendo did something like this with its character following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not an option so much for us, however, as we planned to be able to use this same algorithm to have enemies find their way around complex maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of research, we settled on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"&gt;A Star algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. This algorithm basically finds the shortest available route between two points in a grid of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What are we working with here?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may remember from &lt;a href="http://justinlillico.com/2017/12/15/tis-the-season/html"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I use a little piece of software called GameMaker Studio 2. It works pretty well and I have spent many hours coding in its GML language so I am aware mostly of its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMS2 has this concept of objects in it which is great. You can create objects and within each one is housed all of its code that is ran for every loop of the game. Objects can also inherit from each other just like any other object-oriented language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Player&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Basic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;movement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;movement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keyboard_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vk_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keyboard_check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vk_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Checks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;movement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The above code here runs inside of the player objects &lt;em&gt;step&lt;/em&gt; event. This runs every frame. This will either move the player forward or backward or not at all depending on what is pressed. Super easy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at what cost…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main cost is not being able to define your own classes. Building custom data structures can be a real pain. I read somewhere (sorry, i cant remember where) that the creators tacked on some functions that build pseudo-data structures after GameMaker became popular as it was originally intended as a simple learning language. Things like lists, maps (aka dictionaries), grids (dynamic 2d arrays), stacks, queues etc. were implemented. For the most part, these are sufficient to build some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to build a network of nodes that I can store my own custom properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;node = {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;        &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; : [],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;        &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; : [],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;        neighbours : [&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;                {&amp;quot;relationship_type&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;node&amp;quot; : node}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;        ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the properties I need to store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Star gets a little complicated.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A star is pretty hectic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically goes through a set of nodes and checks the distance from the origin in node hopes and the Manhatten distance to the destination while noting a whole bunch of information on the way. Once it arrives at the end, it goes back through the nodes it found and from this data deduces the shortest path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we had to do first was create a grid that divided the whole playable gaming area up into squares. Then we had to write some fairly complicated code to determine which of these squares was actually traversable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't end there. We next needed to calculate the relationship between all these nodes based on the rules of the system. How high can you jump? How fast can you walk? This took a special amount of time to deduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had all of that, we could plug in our A Star and it would give us a path. We simply tell a sprite to follow the coordinates it output and bam! You have a working AI traversal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I've learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I had no access to custom classes, I was forced to use a horrible mish-mash of maps and grids to store this data. This caused an unnecessary gap between my mind as a developer and what the computer is actually doing as a lot of this code is incomprehensible without a few hours to recap and some decent documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, GMS2 may be more limited than I had initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do love it for its simplicity but it is exactly that which causes these kind of problems. I'd imagine had I had the ability to make classes, I would have created node and path classes; each with some super awesome methods and properties to make this puzzle far better abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future, we may consider using Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing this experience makes me want to do is record a video tutorial on how to set A Star up in GMS2 as we put a lot of effort into it and resources were limited for us. I may post a link to that in here in the coming months. Finding the time could be difficult but I really would like to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, we are going to put this project on hold and make a smaller title using GMS2. I think this is a good decision for the immediate future for us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm Back</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/im-back.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-21T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2019-05-21T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2019-05-21:/im-back.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's been a while and I apologise. I haven't stopped though, I have just been busy getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's been a while and I apologise. I haven't stopped though, I have just been busy getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s been happening? That was more of a rhetorical question as you are reading and I have hopefully moved on since writing this. I’ve been working. A lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;University&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still completing my university degree with one more semester after the current to go. This year, I am studying Algorithms &amp;amp; Complexity which of course is a super interesting subject, though if I’m honest, is being communicated poorly. The lecturer just reads walls of text off a screen and shows working in a limited way which is not helpful to me. I usually just check the current subject he is discussing and use YouTube to learn it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other subject is the Capstone Project. In this subject, we are given an industry project by the university and told to do it over two semesters to give us experience in the real world. We were given a project requiring us to upgrade a previous years project. This was a board that special education students could interact with ina way that compliments their particular disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the process of finalising our plans. We decided to upgrade the hardware in the board to make it function independently. We are using a Raspberry Pi, Python and the library PyGame to create something interactive that is capable of switching on and off different output devices. So far, the unit has been quite rewarding and I am absolutely invested in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Game Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this has been getting a little difficult to squeeze in given the volume of responsibilities I have been investing myself in. But as slow as it may be, I am passionate about these side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I last posted in here, I completed to mini 'for laughs' project and have moved on to creating something else. I got myself a couple of partners and started a business, &lt;a href="http://antitype.com.au/"&gt;AntiType&lt;/a&gt;. We are a group of three: an Artist, a Writer and myself (the coder). We were working on an up and coming platformer called For Loot &amp;amp; Glory (based on our writers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Loot-Glory-Complete-Trilogy-Tales-ebook/dp/B07R44YFPN"&gt;trilogy&lt;/a&gt;). But alas, it was too ambitious. That project is on hold until we get some experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now in the process of fleshing out a new concept game that will be available at the end of the year. We are playing this one pretty close to our chest so watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Band&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news on this front is not great. Unfortunately, we all decided to part ways. My reason for doing so was I had simply bitten off more than I could chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I hope this is in my future again, for now, I am a former rockstar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog turned out to be useful for getting work. At the beginning of 2018, I got a job at a company called &lt;a href="www.colourwise.com.au"&gt;Colourwise&lt;/a&gt;. We specialise in direct marketing and I am responsible for developing automated systems that run regular jobs and building templates for ad hoc work. It's fantastic. So fantastic, that I forgot to post on here for over a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my new occupation, I have been getting very familiar with the Python programming language. I have had the privilege of building from scratch a library for interacting with our printing software more efficiently which are giving me an ever-deepening understanding of Python. I find it fascinating and am so grateful for the many opportunities I have been given to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry this was such a long post. I just wanted to catch up on a few items before getting into the more concise stuff. Next week, I might show some of the things I have been doing over the last year in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, stay classy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Happy New Year</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/happy-new-year.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-03T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2018-01-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2018-01-03:/happy-new-year.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey gang! It’s been a while since I wrote on here and that has mainly been because I haven’t really had anything to say. But I have thought of something I would like to say now, and I am going to take this opportunity to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas break, I was fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time with some good people. We ate, we drank and were merry. During this reprieve from the soulless corporate machine I humbly serve, I was able to get some perspective on the year ahead of me. I know what you’re thinking: ‘ah, here come the New Year’s Resolutions,’ but I promise it’s not! I hate them. I tell myself it is because I think that it puts too much pressure on people to get things done and causes their inevitable burn-outs and failures but it’s probably really because I think it’s cool to go against the current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this year I’m committing to the things that need to be done. I need to work harder on this site and produce some more quality content. I am thinking about starting some video tutorials here as well. I am going to put more effort into my health by purchasing more fresh food rather than the rubbish I usually eat on the go. I am completely cutting alcohol out of my diet because it makes my brain foggy and this organ could be valuable in a science-type career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important quote I read that resonates with me and I feel it sums up the direction of my current thoughts well. Most places you find it on the internet it has been erroneously attributed to the late Aristotle. The quote is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some juicy flesh to this statement. I mean, in a lot of ways it is common sense. You can’t just be a serial killer then save a little girl from a burning house to be considered excellent. You can no more design an okay website once and go back to playing video games every day by the same token. It is in working at this repetition that we can begin to build something worth holding on to. That repetition can be automated by developing habits. There’s a little personal philosophy from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard it said once that it takes around three months to cement a habit. So, join with me and let's start investing in a happy future!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Tis the season...</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/tis-the-season.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-15T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-12-15T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-12-15:/tis-the-season.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey gang! Just checking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ‘tis the season to be jolly and what not so I am allowing myself to take some R&amp;amp;R. Ergo I have temporarily suspended work on the platform I was working on. I’m not going into business for myself to work the holidays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to continue my studies next year doing two units a semester for three more semesters then its done. I will spend a month or two at the start of next year learning the WordPress platform also. While I prefer building things from nothing -- as I am sure most programmers do -- I cannot help but concede that both the quality and quantity of my work would greatly benefit from the use of a framework such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then be looking for freelance work in this area hoping to hone my skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the immediate plan. Also, in my spare time I have been playing around with game design using software called GameMaker. Basically, a framework that allows for rapid development of 2D games. Of course, being a framework, it limits the kind of outside-the-box thinking you can do in terms of mechanics during development, but my god it makes it easy to translate ideas into reality fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So currently, I am using this software to build a game about one of my mates just for kicks. Might even get good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought I couldn’t &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; have anymore to say I also had a gig in the city just the weekend gone. We all felt as though we had done a less than amazing job on the stage but we all thought each other did a great job. So it’s clearly a confidence thing. We had an enjoyable time and learnt a great deal about how playing on a stage works. Can’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So people, I know this is a deviation from my usual theme oriented posts, but things are crazy right now with all this festive stuff. I will probably take a week or two off here unless I come up with some sweet posts. But I’ll be back in the new year. Potentially my first post will be over on my personal blog. I’ll link that up at some point when I’m done adding content. It is just basically stuff I think about that isn’t programming related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World peace etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers and Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>A Little Story</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/a-little-story.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-06T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-12-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-12-06:/a-little-story.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell ya’ll a story. Yes, I’m Australian and that slang isn’t commonplace, but neither am I so whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell ya’ll a story. Yes, I’m Australian and that slang isn’t commonplace, but neither am I so whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am from a tiny little island right down the bottom of this country called Tasmania. I guess you could call it ‘the land down under the land down under’ but you probably shouldn’t as that sounds quite confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early twenties, my partner and I decided to move to Queensland with our son. I got a job as a plastics engineer (sounds technical, but I just watched a machine run all day and made sure it didn’t stop) and we were pottering along just swimmingly. Eventually, we ended up separating after four years as we realised we were significantly different people. Me being young and having no family around to support me, I made the difficult decision to move back to this little island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down there, it gets cold. So cold that in some regions, the grass feels more like stone as it doesn’t give way to your weight in the frosty morning air. I can only assume this is the main reason it is so devoid of any activity. It is quite empty and the potential for economic opportunity down there is almost exclusively restricted to retail or labour industries. Ergo, I got an apprenticeship as a &lt;em&gt;retail&lt;/em&gt; Butcher by the good graces of a mate of mine. All was well for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My occupation was a good one. It was stable and once the apprenticeship was over, it paid well. But after a while, there was no challenge for me cognitively and I felt a bit trapped. If I’m honest though, I totally envy those around me who could derive satisfaction from it. How much easier would my life have been if I had that ability? So the problem now was &lt;em&gt;where to?&lt;/em&gt; I am way too delicate to toil the fields all day long. If I had to live off the sweat of my brow, I may well end up not living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I should get out while I was still young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, It wasn’t the location that was the problem. I may not have realised it at the time, but in fact, it is one of the best places on earth. But I needed to leave to get that perspective and to acquire the bountiful knowledge I have today. I left back to Brisbane to be with my son and see what else was out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked another job as a butcher on a factory line and it was only then I was able to see retail as some kind of divine utopia by comparison. It was so bad. I quit there and thought to myself ‘right Justin, you gotta get out of this grind while you still can’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting poor. Somehow, by the grace of whatever omnipotent being might be watching over us, I ended up back at the same corporation that I had done my apprenticeship with. I went through a few departments and made my way back into the butchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just part-time work to cover me while I busted through the next colossus of my life: University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a degree in Creative and Professional Writing. I liked writing, I still do (clearly). I had the attitude that I just had to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I knew the career prospects were limited but I was gonna break the mould dammit! Eventually, I became weary with the fickle nature of a subjective science (AKA art) like writing and was at my wits end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine suggested ‘why don’t you do computer science’. I was like ‘woah, there is maths! I couldn’t possibly!?’ But I did it anyway. It’s working out nicely so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;, I told you all of this because not only do I want you to know me, but I want you to understand why I am here. I found computer science in that mess and loved it. I miss my home as well. I want to go back there and buy a block of land and practice being as self-sufficient. Building the micro-engines that drive the web is a part of that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on my way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Jekyll Rocks</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/why-jekyll-rocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-28T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-11-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-11-28:/why-jekyll-rocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you out there probably know a little bit about web development and the various frameworks that are available out there. Some of you may be clever enough to realise that this &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; site is designed with a static site generator developed with Ruby called “Jekyll”. I just thought I might take a moment to go over why I chose to use this fancy little tool as opposed to blowing you all away with my mad server-side coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It’s simple&lt;/strong&gt;
There is no need for super complex bells and whistles when it comes to an online blog or what have you. If I were starting my own Amazon, maybe I might require some database and dynamic server-side scripting, but if I’m honest with myself, I’m not going to be that successful. At least not straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we start out small and easy. Jekyll is great for that. You give it your content and it renders it into pages for you based on templates you specify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It’s fast&lt;/strong&gt;
This is pretty much a no-brainer. No server-side scripting means no server-side work. No work means much faster load times. That’s not to say there is no logic implemented here though. Jekyll comes out of the box with the ability to read a language called &lt;a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/"&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;. Not super flexible but gets the small jobs done nicely. I especially like how you can specify parameters at the beginning of your markdown sheets and use them in your templates as variables essentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Blog integration&lt;/strong&gt;
So you don’t need to mess about trying to get your blog to work, Jekyll does all the heavy lifting. As I touched on before, it can read markdown files and render them into readable blog posts. Pretty neat, so much so that I had to use that lame expression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can just hop onto an md editor like &lt;a href="https://dillinger.io/"&gt;Dilinger&lt;/a&gt; like I am right now or design your own md editor and get stuck into it. I made my own but found Dillinger to be pretty effective. Look up a markdown cheat sheet like &lt;a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; to make the whole process easier, but diving in blind worked fine for me to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. GitHub integration&lt;/strong&gt;
GitHub is compatible with Jekyll which is awesome. You just tweak a few settings and you can update your site with some simple pushing and pulling as you would any other repo. This is great for me because it meant simply buying a domain name off some cheap company and directing it to my repo. So all I do now when I want to tweak the site is load up Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine (running windows, I like overwatch) and run the &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; command in the terminal and I'm away to the races. Push my work and within seconds, the site is up to date and behaving exactly as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're just wanting to post a blog post, you can simply login to your GitHub account, navigate to the &lt;code&gt;_posts/&lt;/code&gt; directory and drag your md files that you produced with an online tool into the folder. It will automatically appear shortly. Particularly useful when inspiration comes out on the farm or on your jet ski or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It’s delightful&lt;/strong&gt;
Jekyll is a gem (pun intended). It takes something that should be simple and &lt;em&gt;keeps&lt;/em&gt; it that way. There are themes available and its pretty easy to tweak them provided you know some simple concepts of web development. This has been greatly useful to me for learning these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do yourselves a favour and use Jekyll for something. Or don't, I don't really mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning JavaScript</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/learning-javascript.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-24T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-11-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-11-24:/learning-javascript.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you're thinking... Clearly, I should also be learning how to use software like Adobe Illustrator and not rely so heavily on MS Paint. But hey, I know it and have been using it for years, seems to do most things I need it to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this week I have been getting well stuck into developing this website. They gave me the task of creating a method of arranging thumbnails by date, views and type. This proved to be just the level of challenge I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sitting in front of my computer for nearly two days researching the things I could do using the JQuery library and vanilla JavaScript, I built a few functions to take care of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;var js_views_dates = [&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$articles_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; [ &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$articles_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strtotime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$articles_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;] ,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;];&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I converted the existing array containing the views and dates I needed to know into a JavaScript array. I found a few ways to do this but they were all to complex for me at this level so I came up with this method on my own. Basically just writes the JS on the fly by echoing strings. Pretty simple, but effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't bore you with the event listeners. I used Jquery for those. Let's skip to the functions I called AFTER the document was ready...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Get the elements.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;article_box&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Here, we combine the object in its original form along with the views and date gathered from the php.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//0 : views&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//1 : dates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js_views_dates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js_article_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js_views_dates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js_views_dates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//This preserves the original order of the articles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;original_order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js_article_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I get the elements, attach them to the views and dates I got before and save the list as it currently is. I use this when the user chooses to reset from custom arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setupOrder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;original_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;high_low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//This is a sort function that arranges the array by the first dimention, in numeric lowest to highest order&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;original_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;high_low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;original_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I learned what the sort() function did and how to get it to do my bidding. I feel like this is a function I may end up taking advantage of a lot. This is called when the user chooses the arrangement they want. It sets the order of the list based on an integer value representing their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateArticles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//This while loop simply removes the contents of the parent div by ID.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;article_box&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasChildNodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;article_box&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;article_box&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this function is called after setupOrder() to update the elements on the page based on the new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had these functions built, the rest of the logic was only a line or two in the event listeners. I feel like it was efficient, although I'm sure there are many other methods and this is far from the most efficient.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Career"></category></entry><entry><title>Back to basics</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/back-to-basics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-19T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-11-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-11-19:/back-to-basics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since my last post, I have begun working as a volunteer. The Arduino project is on hiatus.
&lt;p&gt;
As it happens, it is considerably difficult to acquire paid work when you are but a meagre, inexperienced web developer. And by inexperienced, I mean I don’t have any idea how to build websites. I get the concepts and the word ‘JavaScript’ doesn’t leave me thinking about some kind of dialogue for a coffee cup but as I am rapidly learning, this is not enough.
&lt;p&gt;
I have been graciously afforded an opportunity to get some hands-on experience, even after I admitted I was slowly drowning in alien code. The website I am working on is not being built from the ground up, but my understanding of it is. I am forced to study everything: from where every bit bounces about to what the CSS colour code for deep cyan is. This way I learn its function.
&lt;p&gt;
Luckily for me, when it comes to problem solving, I can’t sleep until I get it. Seriously, I’ve been known to avoid eating—nearly dying as a consequence—in order to just fix that one little problem… But I suppose that’s a common attribute for coders. We love the punishment. I am a precious little snowflake though. I like to stare at these riddles for so long that the symbols that represent math and logic slowly become stripped of their meaning. Some people like football, I like brain melting. What of it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, I learn this way. As a wise man (aka Turk from the hit television series Scrubs) once said: learn by doing. I find it works best for me. So, while I may be at school, have no experience, thirty years old and currently exchanging precious hours of my life for money carving up deceased beasts, I have this tenacious drive on my side.
&lt;p&gt;
If you are a potential employer reading this, please don’t be deterred. I am actually quite professional.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Career"></category></entry><entry><title>Arduino Meltdown</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/arduino-meltdown.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-10T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-10-10T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-10-10:/arduino-meltdown.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I blew up my arduino. I have been working on a project that involves regulating the temperature inside
a refridgerater using the built in compressor and a small heater. You guys will hear all about it in the portfolio section
when it is finished. Seriously, I've been recording the whole thing. 
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, today I was trying to wire in these new relays I got from the job and ended up absent mindedly letting the
end of a wire bridge a component on the Ardunio board and it started smoking at me. 
&lt;p&gt;
So that's a thing that happened, I'll soon have another one so never fear!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="projects"></category></entry><entry><title>Projects projects projects!</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/projects-projects-projects.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-09T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-10-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-10-09:/projects-projects-projects.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G'day! So, this is my first blog post. My name is Justin, as I am sure you have deduced from the domain name, and I am a web developer/guitarist/butcher. Actually, I dare say I am perhaps the only one you know.

&lt;p&gt;G'day! So, this is my first blog post. My name is Justin, as I am sure you have deduced from the domain name, and I am a web developer/guitarist/butcher. Actually, I dare say I am perhaps the only one you know.
&lt;p&gt;
So I am currently studying at the Queensland University of Technology to get my degree in Computer Science which seems to be going quite swimmingly. That is the main project at the moment. I am also working part-time as a supermarket butcher and singing in a rock 'n' roll band. I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you, whoever you are, but let me just give you a red hot tip and tell you it is quite a bit of work.
&lt;p&gt;
That being said, I haven't currently a lot of room for other projects and the ones I do find time to work on progress quite slowly. Nevermind that though, I have a few cracking ideas to show you all so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry></feed>
