&lt;p&gt;I once set a fridge on fire. It was knackered and laying on its side in the Tasmanian wilderness when we found it, having assumably ceased to keep things cold at some point in its life. We had spent the afternoon tearing up 4WD trails and drinking many litres of beer but now, the light was rapidly vanishing behind the mountains in the west. It was getting colder, and as it was already cold (being Tasmania), we had no desire to get any colder. So we had managed to extract some petroleum from the fuel tank to burn. We struggled to keep a flame against the strong, icy breeze so we had the brilliant idea of using this fridge as a fire pot. Before we knew it, there was black smoke billowing out of it uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night was fun. Not because we set the fridge on fire, but the 4WDing itself was great. I quite enjoy driving down seemingly impossible paths and drinking my weight in alcohol. Maybe it’s in my blood or perhaps I was more carefree back then than I am now. Either way, I’d like my kids to be able to enjoy the same things I have. It is also important to me that maintain a healthy respect for the environment in which they are doing it. I don’t think you have to be a koala-shooting redneck to enjoy these kinds of things. If done in the same place and care is taken not to throw stuff out the windows and what not, I think the impact is fairly manageable. The fridge fire was an accident ok? Don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, bushlands like the one I used to enjoy has been burning uncontrollably, taking lives and homes with it. It has been a really dark time for all of us Australians. Social media has been absolutely awash with politically polarised ideas on who is to blame. I have seen videos of people just yelling at a camera about who they think is to blame for the current events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, there seems to be two sides to the argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Greenies did it! They let our dead wood build up over time with their stupid environment policies and now the whole country is on fire and they are trying to cover it up!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The climate is warming. We haven’t seen any rain in a year and the temperature of the planet is generally one degree warmer than it was in 1910”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is the world going to superheat like an oven and cook us human beings like chooks? Or are we all just the victims of environmental extremism? It is hard for most people to get access to accurate information to answer this question for themselves. There are so many reasons to distrust the powers that be and X website tells you one thing while Y tells you another. Then you have the government swearing black and blue that they didn’t do it and the fault lies at the feet of the Greens. It’s an attractive idea to a lot of people because a simple line of reasoning clearly shows who is to blame. It’s unfortunate that is actually is not accurate. Here is an excerpt from the party’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Hazard reduction, including manual, mechanical and hazard reduction burning activities should be strategically planned to protect the community and vulnerable assets while minimising the adverse impacts of these activities on the environment;”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I have spent a great deal of time trying to find any evidence at all that The Greens are responsible for this, but all that is available is Barnaby Joyce’s casual conjecture that “the two people that died were people who most likely voted for The Green party”[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As this isn’t particularly compelling, that more or less makes this a conspiracy theory and I don’t much like conspiracy theories, but the reasons for that are for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a government at the moment that is happy to exploit their people’s fear and completely ignore the global catastrophe that is looming around the corner and to be honest, it is becoming somewhat alarming. Every day that goes by with these people in charge pointing their finger at everyone but themselves while people’s lives are being destroyed is one more day we can’t get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have kids, you know that they can be little terrorists. One thing they like to do when they’re little and haven’t received the proper amount of discipline yet is lie. They say it was Suzie who ate all the chocolate cake, all the while their hands are covered in chocolate covered debris. We (hopefully) explain to our kids that finger pointing is bad, especially when it is unfactual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you think it’s time we tell the liberals the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's been a while and I apologise. I haven't stopped though, I have just been busy getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's been a while and I apologise. I haven't stopped though, I have just been busy getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s been happening? That was more of a rhetorical question as you are reading and I have hopefully moved on since writing this. I’ve been working. A lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;University&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still completing my university degree with one more semester after the current to go. This year, I am studying Algorithms &amp;amp; Complexity which of course is a super interesting subject, though if I’m honest, is being communicated poorly. The lecturer just reads walls of text off a screen and shows working in a limited way which is not helpful to me. I usually just check the current subject he is discussing and use YouTube to learn it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other subject is the Capstone Project. In this subject, we are given an industry project by the university and told to do it over two semesters to give us experience in the real world. We were given a project requiring us to upgrade a previous years project. This was a board that special education students could interact with ina way that compliments their particular disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the process of finalising our plans. We decided to upgrade the hardware in the board to make it function independently. We are using a Raspberry Pi, Python and the library PyGame to create something interactive that is capable of switching on and off different output devices. So far, the unit has been quite rewarding and I am absolutely invested in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Game Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this has been getting a little difficult to squeeze in given the volume of responsibilities I have been investing myself in. But as slow as it may be, I am passionate about these side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I last posted in here, I completed to mini 'for laughs' project and have moved on to creating something else. I got myself a couple of partners and started a business, &lt;a href="http://antitype.com.au/"&gt;AntiType&lt;/a&gt;. We are a group of three: an Artist, a Writer and myself (the coder). We were working on an up and coming platformer called For Loot &amp;amp; Glory (based on our writers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Loot-Glory-Complete-Trilogy-Tales-ebook/dp/B07R44YFPN"&gt;trilogy&lt;/a&gt;). But alas, it was too ambitious. That project is on hold until we get some experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now in the process of fleshing out a new concept game that will be available at the end of the year. We are playing this one pretty close to our chest so watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Band&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news on this front is not great. Unfortunately, we all decided to part ways. My reason for doing so was I had simply bitten off more than I could chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I hope this is in my future again, for now, I am a former rockstar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog turned out to be useful for getting work. At the beginning of 2018, I got a job at a company called &lt;a href="www.colourwise.com.au"&gt;Colourwise&lt;/a&gt;. We specialise in direct marketing and I am responsible for developing automated systems that run regular jobs and building templates for ad hoc work. It's fantastic. So fantastic, that I forgot to post on here for over a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my new occupation, I have been getting very familiar with the Python programming language. I have had the privilege of building from scratch a library for interacting with our printing software more efficiently which are giving me an ever-deepening understanding of Python. I find it fascinating and am so grateful for the many opportunities I have been given to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry this was such a long post. I just wanted to catch up on a few items before getting into the more concise stuff. Next week, I might show some of the things I have been doing over the last year in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, stay classy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Happy New Year</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/happy-new-year.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-03T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2018-01-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2018-01-03:/happy-new-year.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey gang! It’s been a while since I wrote on here and that has mainly been because I haven’t really had anything to say. But I have thought of something I would like to say now, and I am going to take this opportunity to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas break, I was fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time with some good people. We ate, we drank and were merry. During this reprieve from the soulless corporate machine I humbly serve, I was able to get some perspective on the year ahead of me. I know what you’re thinking: ‘ah, here come the New Year’s Resolutions,’ but I promise it’s not! I hate them. I tell myself it is because I think that it puts too much pressure on people to get things done and causes their inevitable burn-outs and failures but it’s probably really because I think it’s cool to go against the current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this year I’m committing to the things that need to be done. I need to work harder on this site and produce some more quality content. I am thinking about starting some video tutorials here as well. I am going to put more effort into my health by purchasing more fresh food rather than the rubbish I usually eat on the go. I am completely cutting alcohol out of my diet because it makes my brain foggy and this organ could be valuable in a science-type career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important quote I read that resonates with me and I feel it sums up the direction of my current thoughts well. Most places you find it on the internet it has been erroneously attributed to the late Aristotle. The quote is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some juicy flesh to this statement. I mean, in a lot of ways it is common sense. You can’t just be a serial killer then save a little girl from a burning house to be considered excellent. You can no more design an okay website once and go back to playing video games every day by the same token. It is in working at this repetition that we can begin to build something worth holding on to. That repetition can be automated by developing habits. There’s a little personal philosophy from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard it said once that it takes around three months to cement a habit. So, join with me and let's start investing in a happy future!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Tis the season...</title><link href="http://www.justinlillico.com/tis-the-season.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-15T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-12-15T00:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Justin Lillico</name></author><id>tag:www.justinlillico.com,2017-12-15:/tis-the-season.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey gang! Just checking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ‘tis the season to be jolly and what not so I am allowing myself to take some R&amp;amp;R. Ergo I have temporarily suspended work on the platform I was working on. I’m not going into business for myself to work the holidays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to continue my studies next year doing two units a semester for three more semesters then its done. I will spend a month or two at the start of next year learning the WordPress platform also. While I prefer building things from nothing -- as I am sure most programmers do -- I cannot help but concede that both the quality and quantity of my work would greatly benefit from the use of a framework such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will then be looking for freelance work in this area hoping to hone my skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is the immediate plan. Also, in my spare time I have been playing around with game design using software called GameMaker. Basically, a framework that allows for rapid development of 2D games. Of course, being a framework, it limits the kind of outside-the-box thinking you can do in terms of mechanics during development, but my god it makes it easy to translate ideas into reality fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So currently, I am using this software to build a game about one of my mates just for kicks. Might even get good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought I couldn’t &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; have anymore to say I also had a gig in the city just the weekend gone. We all felt as though we had done a less than amazing job on the stage but we all thought each other did a great job. So it’s clearly a confidence thing. We had an enjoyable time and learnt a great deal about how playing on a stage works. Can’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So people, I know this is a deviation from my usual theme oriented posts, but things are crazy right now with all this festive stuff. I will probably take a week or two off here unless I come up with some sweet posts. But I’ll be back in the new year. Potentially my first post will be over on my personal blog. I’ll link that up at some point when I’m done adding content. It is just basically stuff I think about that isn’t programming related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World peace etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell ya’ll a story. Yes, I’m Australian and that slang isn’t commonplace, but neither am I so whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell ya’ll a story. Yes, I’m Australian and that slang isn’t commonplace, but neither am I so whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am from a tiny little island right down the bottom of this country called Tasmania. I guess you could call it ‘the land down under the land down under’ but you probably shouldn’t as that sounds quite confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early twenties, my partner and I decided to move to Queensland with our son. I got a job as a plastics engineer (sounds technical, but I just watched a machine run all day and made sure it didn’t stop) and we were pottering along just swimmingly. Eventually, we ended up separating after four years as we realised we were significantly different people. Me being young and having no family around to support me, I made the difficult decision to move back to this little island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down there, it gets cold. So cold that in some regions, the grass feels more like stone as it doesn’t give way to your weight in the frosty morning air. I can only assume this is the main reason it is so devoid of any activity. It is quite empty and the potential for economic opportunity down there is almost exclusively restricted to retail or labour industries. Ergo, I got an apprenticeship as a &lt;em&gt;retail&lt;/em&gt; Butcher by the good graces of a mate of mine. All was well for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My occupation was a good one. It was stable and once the apprenticeship was over, it paid well. But after a while, there was no challenge for me cognitively and I felt a bit trapped. If I’m honest though, I totally envy those around me who could derive satisfaction from it. How much easier would my life have been if I had that ability? So the problem now was &lt;em&gt;where to?&lt;/em&gt; I am way too delicate to toil the fields all day long. If I had to live off the sweat of my brow, I may well end up not living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I should get out while I was still young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, It wasn’t the location that was the problem. I may not have realised it at the time, but in fact, it is one of the best places on earth. But I needed to leave to get that perspective and to acquire the bountiful knowledge I have today. I left back to Brisbane to be with my son and see what else was out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked another job as a butcher on a factory line and it was only then I was able to see retail as some kind of divine utopia by comparison. It was so bad. I quit there and thought to myself ‘right Justin, you gotta get out of this grind while you still can’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting poor. Somehow, by the grace of whatever omnipotent being might be watching over us, I ended up back at the same corporation that I had done my apprenticeship with. I went through a few departments and made my way back into the butchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just part-time work to cover me while I busted through the next colossus of my life: University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a degree in Creative and Professional Writing. I liked writing, I still do (clearly). I had the attitude that I just had to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. I knew the career prospects were limited but I was gonna break the mould dammit! Eventually, I became weary with the fickle nature of a subjective science (AKA art) like writing and was at my wits end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine suggested ‘why don’t you do computer science’. I was like ‘woah, there is maths! I couldn’t possibly!?’ But I did it anyway. It’s working out nicely so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;, I told you all of this because not only do I want you to know me, but I want you to understand why I am here. I found computer science in that mess and loved it. I miss my home as well. I want to go back there and buy a block of land and practice being as self-sufficient. Building the micro-engines that drive the web is a part of that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on my way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Personal"></category></entry></feed>
