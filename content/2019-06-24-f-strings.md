# Another way to concatenate strings.

Hi guys, sorry it's been a fortnight! I've been hella busy and still am so this is going to be short.



So I recently discovered the f-string in python.



```python
a_string = " are pretty damned cool!"
print("f-strings" + a_string)
```



So I'm sure most of us are familiar with the above for good old string concatenation. If you are super tricky, you might even know…



```python
a_string = " are pretty damned cool!"
print("f-strings{0}").format(a_string)
```



These are both well and good, but I have recently learned of a method i enjoy more than both of these.



```python
a_string = " are pretty damned cool!"
print(f"f-strings{a_string}")
```



Simple. Concise. Beautiful.



Stay tuned for next week!
