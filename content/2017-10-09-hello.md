G'day! So, this is my first blog post. My name is Justin, as I am sure you have deduced from the domain name, and I am a web developer/guitarist/butcher. Actually, I dare say I am perhaps the only one you know.
<p>
So I am currently studying at the Queensland University of Technology to get my degree in Computer Science which seems to be going quite swimmingly. That is the main project at the moment. I am also working part-time as a supermarket butcher and singing in a rock 'n' roll band. I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you, whoever you are, but let me just give you a red hot tip and tell you it is quite a bit of work.
<p>
That being said, I haven't currently a lot of room for other projects and the ones I do find time to work on progress quite slowly. Nevermind that though, I have a few cracking ideas to show you all so stay tuned!
