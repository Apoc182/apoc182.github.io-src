So today I blew up my arduino. I have been working on a project that involves regulating the temperature inside
a refridgerater using the built in compressor and a small heater. You guys will hear all about it in the portfolio section
when it is finished. Seriously, I've been recording the whole thing. 
<p>
Anyway, today I was trying to wire in these new relays I got from the job and ended up absent mindedly letting the
end of a wire bridge a component on the Ardunio board and it started smoking at me. 
<p>
So that's a thing that happened, I'll soon have another one so never fear!
