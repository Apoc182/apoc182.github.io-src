You read the text and it says something that makes a knot in your stomach. You are almost sure it isn’t rage, but its something that none-the-less indicates to you that the information here is an incomplete illustration of reality and you want to offer what it is you have to it. So you do. You bash down on those keys or tap away at that screen to relay the inner workings of your mind to the rest of the world. It is a courageous act for sure you think.

Once you have it out, you think you have done your part. It is out of you and out in the world for all to see. In only a matter of minutes, you find responses. You expect perhaps someone is thanking you for clarifying their thinking. When you read it, you can taste the venom they are spitting in your direction. For some reason, they are outraged by your response. But you don't understand. You took every care to say it correctly and the intention behind it was clearly one of compassion. So why the attack?

People do not like to be wrong. They don’t like being told anything they don't agree with for that matter so it is inevitable that this is going to happen. 

You continue the conversation trying your best to ignore the little hot flashes of rage coming from the pit of your stomach. You’re all too human and you know it. Somewhere in amongst the now frantic respites and bursts, however, you realise there is an even heavier burden on your soul now. 

You were wrong.

How could you be wrong? You had spent countless hours googling everything there was to know about this subject. Yet here you are, in your kitchen at 10pm on a Friday arguing with a 60 year old trucker who just so happens to be right in one facet of his reasoning you had not even considered.

It’s okay though you think. He has more experience than you, he is bound to know something that you don’t. You take a moment to recompose yourself and maybe have another beer outside with the dog. You must remember you are not here to be correct. You are here to make things better; an easy thing to forget. 

After ten minutes or so of though, you recollect yourself and return to the computer with a revised version of your argument. You are careful to apologise where you knew you were wrong and to continue to push forward what you still consider to be relevant that Johnno is not understanding correctly. You are almost sure this will get through to him. Then he calls you a ‘fuckwit’ and you never hear from him again.

The internet can be a nasty place. A repository of all the repressed thoughts of a generation would perhaps not be a bad way to describe it. Some of those among us have a great deal to say and others just like to stir the pot and see what kind of reactions they will get if they say something completely outrageous.

In amongst this web of psychosis there will often come a time where you see something that you consider to be incorrect; or at least not completely accurate in your thoughts. To clarify, I am not saying that you should necessarily consider this initial thought about the problem to be accurate or right by any means. But I am saying that you have something to contribute to the discussion and everyone involved would probably be better off if you said it.

It can be hard to inject this information into a real-world conversation with real-world consequences, but that is no reason to shy away. This blog post is more of a reflection for me than a guide for anyone else. I do not necessarily practice what I preach in this case.

If you have something to say, you should say it. But you are going to have to be prepared to fight. The reason for this is the same reason you feel the need to say it in the first place. It is because people are all just as sure of themselves as you are.

You could make the argument that perhaps it would just be better to keep your mouth shut. Indeed, in some ways this philosophy makes more sense. But then the rest of the world would be stuck in an echo chamber with all the other more savage people who have no problem throwing their hat into the ring for a good beating.

So be prepared to defend what you think until the bitter end. Unless of course you realise you are wrong. In that case, revise where you went wrong and move on.
